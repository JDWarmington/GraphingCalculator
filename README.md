Jackson's Graphing Calculator

Overview

Jackson's Graphing Calculator is a web-based tool that allows users to graph mathematical equations, analyze functions, and interact with plotted data points. It supports standard function plotting, vertical lines, zooming, panning, and numerical integration for area calculations.

Features

Graphing Equations: Users can input mathematical expressions, and the calculator will plot them dynamically.

Dynamic Input Fields: Users can add multiple equations dynamically, and empty inputs are automatically removed.

Zoom & Pan: Users can zoom in and out using the mouse wheel and pan using click-and-drag functionality.

Equation Buttons: Users can insert common mathematical functions such as square roots and derivatives easily.

Point Hovering & Pinning: Hovering over a function displays the nearest coordinate, and clicking pins a point for further analysis.

Area Calculation: The calculator supports numerical integration for computing the area under a curve.

Reset View: A home button resets the graph to the default zoom and position.

Technologies Used

HTML: Structure of the web page.

CSS: Styling for layout and appearance.

JavaScript: Functionality and interactivity.

Math.js: Mathematical parsing and computation.

Installation & Usage

Clone or download the project files.

Open index.html in any modern web browser.

Enter mathematical equations in the input fields to graph them.

Use the provided buttons for additional mathematical operations.

Interact with the graph using the mouse (zoom, pan, click on points).

Controls

Graph Input: Enter equations in the text fields (e.g., x^2, sin(x), x=2).

Zoom: Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

Pan: Click and drag to move the graph.

Pin a Point: Click on a function to pin a coordinate.

Area Calculation: Click on a function, then press f'(x) to compute the area from x=0 to the pinned point.

Reset View: Click the home button (⌂) to return to the default graph view.
